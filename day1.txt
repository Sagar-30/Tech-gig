Practice Questions:
 
1.What’s the difference between props and state?
props are short term of properties.props are the data which we pass from parent component to child component.
props are unidirectional means parent component can pass the prop to child but child can't.
props are read only properties means we can't change or modify it.
 
2.Write a small component using useState to manage a counter.

import {useState} from "react";
export default function counter(){
const[count,setCount] = useState(0);
return(
<div>
<button onClick={()=>setCount(count+1)}>Increment</button>
<p>{count}</p>
<button onClick={()=>setCount(count-1)}>Decrement</button>
</div>
)
}
 
3.What’s the purpose of useEffect with an empty dependency array?

empty dependency array runt only one time when the page loads so all the side effects which were in useEffect executes on page load.
 
4.How do you conditionally render a component in React?

suppose we have two component and we want to load them on page load
import {useState} from "react"
import MainComponent from "./MainCoomponent.jsx"
Ex: export default function App(){
const[load,setLoad] = useState(true);
return(
<div>
{load ? <p className="Loading-msg">Loading...</p> : <MainCoomponent />}
</div>
)
}
 
5.Write a simple form with an input and button that logs the value on submit.

export default function App(){
const[Name,setName] = useState(true);
function handleSubmit(e){
e.preventDefault();
console.log(Name);
}
return(
<div>
<form>
<input type="text" onChange={(e)=>setName(e.target.value)}>Enter Name</input>
<button onClick={(e)=>handleSubmit(e)}>Submit</button>
</form>
</div>
)
}
